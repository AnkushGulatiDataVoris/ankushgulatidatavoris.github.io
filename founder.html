            <div class="founder-story">
                <p>
                    Hi, I’m <strong>Ankush Gulati</strong> — a Data Scientist and Automation Architect
                    who believes that data systems should work for people, not create more work for them.
                    My journey into automation started long before Datavoris existed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I began as a freelancer, working with businesses who needed dashboards, clarity,
                    and fast reporting. But it didn’t take long to realize the real problem wasn’t
                    dashboards — it was broken systems. Every company I worked with struggled with
                    manual spreadsheets, inconsistent reports, and hours wasted every week on tasks
                    that could be automated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I saw teams drowning in Excel files. Leaders making decisions on outdated numbers.
                    Consultants spending hours generating diagnostic reports manually. I knew this
                    wasn’t a “data problem” — it was a **systems problem**.
                </p>

                <h3>Why I Started Datavoris</h3>
                <p>
                    Datavoris was created with a simple purpose:
                    <br><strong>to help businesses move from chaos to clarity through automation.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I wanted to build a company that creates practical, fast, reliable automation —
                    not theoretical data models or fancy slides. Real systems that save time, reduce
                    errors, and let teams focus on the work that matters.
                </p>

                <h3>My Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    At Datavoris, my mission is to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make automation accessible for every business</li>
                    <li>Eliminate repetitive manual reporting</li>
                    <li>Build dashboards that answer REAL business questions</li>
                    <li>Fix data pipelines, not just visualize problems</li>
                    <li>Empower teams to make confident, data-driven decisions</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Milestones So Far</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built <strong>100+ automated reports</strong> for businesses & SMEs</li>
                    <li>Developed diagnostic engines used by 120+ coaches & consultants</li>
                    <li>Architected multi-client data warehouse solutions</li>
                    <li>Automated Google Form → Sheet → Python → PDF workflows</li>
                    <li>Designed AI-driven content & insight systems</li>
                    <li>Created streamlined Power BI dashboards across industries</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                <p>
                    My vision is to scale Datavoris as a leading automation-first data solutions brand.
                    To build reusable systems, diagnostic engines, and AI assistants that help thousands
                    of businesses eliminate manual work forever.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Datavoris is not just a company — it’s a movement towards smarter, efficient,
                    frictionless work.
                </p>
